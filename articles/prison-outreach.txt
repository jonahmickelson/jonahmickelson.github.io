Indigenous Math Outreach in Prison: My Experience

Introduction:

I would like to begin by acknowledging Dr. Alia Sajjad and Dr. Rustum Choksi for their support
in organizing the workshop and coordinating with the Joliette Institution for Women staff.
Without their efforts, I doubt a second workshop would have taken place. Their guidance
throughout the Indigenous Math Outreach in Prison course also helped us better prepare and plan
for the sessions. I also want to extend a sincere thank you to Josh Goldman, who served as our
leader and played a crucial role in helping us get ready.
This report outlines my experience co-leading the workshop with Daniella at Joliette on Friday,
April 25th, 2025. The first workshop, on February 21st led by Alex, Rylan, and Josh, focused on
teaching Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint. Our goal for April 25th was to introduce
Microsoft Excel and build on the past PowerPoint content. This report will describe our plan,
highlight what worked and what didn’t, and conclude with my personal reflections on the day.

Preparation and Plan:

Josh, who participated in the previous iteration of the course, led a workshop at Joliette on
October 25, 2024, that introduced the basics of Excel. We expected that most of the students we
would be teaching had attended that session. For that reason, we planned a brief review of key
Excel functions. To make this review more engaging, we decided to poll the class and create a
small table that combined qualitative and quantitative data. We collected information such as
Name, Age, Height, Number of Siblings, Province, Number of Kids, Number of Pets, and
Favourite Ice Cream Flavour, which was suggested by one of the students.

After refreshing the students on the basic formulas used for data analysis, we planned to help
them explore their own hypothesis questions using one of the datasets we brought. At the
October workshop, Josh’s group used a dataset on drug decriminalization. Because that topic was
highly personal and sensitive for some inmates, Josh advised us to choose something different.
We selected three datasets that allowed for meaningful analysis while avoiding potentially
sensitive topics. The first was a climate dataset that included monthly temperature, precipitation,
and snowfall records for each province since 1917. The second came from the Government of
Canada and was titled Self-rated ability to speak and understand an Indigenous language. The
third included NHL player data from the 2023–2024 season, covering goals, assists, points, and
other stats. Our hope was that each student would choose the dataset that most interested them,
and that Daniella, Duru, and I would guide them in exploring a hypothesis using Excel skills.
Because we knew the class would be small and that students would have different levels of
experience with Excel, we wanted to work with them one-on-one. This made preparation more
challenging, since we couldn’t predict exactly what would be needed and we were not Excel
experts ourselves. To prepare, we conducted our own analysis on the datasets and became
familiar with the formulas and tools we would likely need to support the students.

For the PowerPoint portion of the workshop in the afternoon, we planned for students to build a
presentation based on their hypothesis and analysis. We also brought photos related to the themes
of each dataset that they could incorporate into their presentations. To provide guidance, we
prepared our own demo presentation as an example. Lastly, we created a short workbook with
key Excel shortcuts, explanations of the functions we were teaching, and exploratory questions
to help students decide on their hypothesis.

My Experience:

We encountered an initial challenge the evening prior, when Duru informed the team around
11:00 p.m. that there were issues with her clearance forms and that she might be unable to attend.
As each group member had focused on a different dataset, Daniella and I reviewed the NHL
dataset, which had been Duru’s responsibility, to ensure we were prepared to cover that content,
if necessary. On the morning of the workshop, Daniella and I met Josh outside the McConnell
Engineering Building at approximately 7:30 a.m. for our scheduled Uber to Joliette. During the
ride, we conducted a final review of the workshop structure and plan. We arrived at Joliette
around 8:40 a.m. Upon arrival, I took a photo near the facility exterior; however, we were
instructed to delete it immediately via intercom and again upon entering security. Oops.
We were met by Jessica and Jacob in the parking lot. Jessica served as our main point of contact
following Robin’s departure and played a key role in workshop coordination. Jacob, primarily
based at Archambault prison, joined to support the session and was a tremendous help. At the
front desk, we were informed by the correctional officer that neither Daniella nor I were listed as
cleared visitors. It was later determined that staff had been expecting Josh, Alex, and Rylan to
return, and had not received our submitted forms. While we waited in the lobby, Jessica worked
to resolve the issue. Approximately thirty minutes later, the warden granted us special one-day
clearance. As we prepared to enter the facility, a further issue arose regarding the laptop, which
contained key workshop materials including our demo presentation. Permission to bring the
computer inside had not yet been secured. Jessica left again to obtain approval, which was
granted after a brief delay. We subsequently passed through security and entered the education
wing shortly before the scheduled 9:30 a.m. start.

The classroom consisted of six students, each with an individual computer and desk. The room
was relatively small, with three rows of two desks, separated by a center aisle. At the front, a
large monitor allowed us to project our materials from the laptop. Login and password issues for
several students delayed the start of the session by approximately 20 to 30 minutes. During this
time, I engaged with one of the students to give a sneak peek of the day’s activities. This is when
it became apparent to me that none of the materials submitted in advance for preloading onto the
classroom computers were not present. The only file accessible on their system was the drug
decriminalization dataset used in the previous workshop, which had been distressing for some
participants. As a result, we made a real time decision to shift our plan and perform our analysis
with the dataset we built with the class instead.

The remainder of the morning session proceeded smoothly. Students were actively engaged in
the data collection and entry process. We created a simple dataset using variables seen in Figure
1. The first activity introduced arithmetic operations through the conversion of heights from feet
to centimeters. This was followed by an introduction to basic Excel functions, including MAX,
MIN, AVERAGE, and SUM. During this stage, we encountered a technical complication. The
French-language version of Excel required different syntax conventions, such as commas instead
of periods for decimals, and semicolons rather than commas to separate function arguments. In
addition, some function names were not directly translatable. In one instance, we were unable to
locate the French equivalent of the COUNTIF function and were forced to skip that segment of
the lesson. Despite these challenges, we adapted accordingly and concluded the morning session
as scheduled.

During the lunch break, Daniella and I reassessed our approach to the PowerPoint component,
given that no hypothesis-based analysis had been completed. Upon returning at 1:00 p.m., only
three of the original six students remained due to various reasons. We presented our demo
PowerPoint; however, the level of engagement was low. In response, we encouraged students to
create presentations on any topic of interest, regardless of its connection to the data. We provided
support as needed, though students appeared to prefer independent, creative work. The
atmosphere in the afternoon was notably more subdued. Jessica later explained that such a
decrease in energy was common and expected during full-day workshops. The session concluded
around 3:30 p.m. Notably, one student expressed interest in our return which was a highlight of
the day. Following the workshop, we debriefed with Jessica and Jacob outside the facility. Our
transportation arrived at approximately 4:15 p.m. to return us to the McConnell Engineering
Building.

Reflections:

On the morning of the workshop, I found myself overthinking my choice of clothing. Although I
had been told that jeans were acceptable, I felt unsure and questioned whether the outfit might
appear too informal. This uncertainty likely stemmed from my own insecurity about my limited
teaching experience. I found myself wondering whether we were truly qualified to be leading the
workshop, given that we were not experts in the subject matter. A conversation with Jessica
during the lunch break helped put these concerns into perspective. She emphasized that the most
important thing was simply to show up and be present. She reassured us that our Excel skills
were more than sufficient for the workshop’s goals, and that attitude and presence mattered more
than expertise. In this regard, I believe Daniella and I demonstrated the right approach.
At the start of the afternoon session, one of the students was delayed due to an issue with the
correctional staff. We had been informed she might be 15 to 30 minutes late, but she ultimately
arrived about 90 minutes into the session and appeared visibly upset. She was the only student
coming from the maximum-security wing, and the guards were unaware that she had been
scheduled to participate in the workshop. As a result, she was initially disengaged and
unreceptive when I tried to prompt her with presentation ideas. However, over time she began
working independently on a PowerPoint presentation about how to properly hunt moose. Her
focus and commitment were remarkable, and witnessing her find a sense of purpose through that
creative task was the most meaningful moment of the day for me. It reaffirmed the broader
purpose of the workshop was to be a creative outlet and a humanizing experience, rather than
simply a lesson in Excel formulas.

After the workshop, I reflected on a conversation we had with Jessica and Jacob. I asked Jessica
whether she knew the personal stories of the women she teaches, and she shared that a common
offense among inmates at Joliette is infanticide. While I felt that I had built strong connections
with the students and appreciated the interactions, I was grateful that I did not know their
specific histories. Although I found the teaching experience deeply rewarding, I recognize that it
would be difficult for me to maintain the same level of connection if I were aware of certain past
actions that I personally find difficult to reconcile with. While I strive to empathize and
understand that I cannot fully grasp the circumstances behind their stories, I acknowledge that I
would find it challenging to completely set those details aside.

Conclusion:

I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to have participated in this course. It was an
invaluable experience, during which I had the chance to meet thoughtful, engaging, and inspiring
individuals. Looking ahead, I believe the continued success of this course requires selecting
participants who are strong communicators and able to adapt in real time. Flexibility and
improvisation are essential, as unexpected challenges are inevitable and plans rarely unfold
exactly as intended. Overall, I believe the course was a success and offered a window into a
world I might never have had the opportunity to see otherwise.
